# Binary Heap

## Max Heap Property

Each node in a tree has a key which is less than or equal to the key of its parent.

Generally, any object that can be compared can be stored in a Binary Max Heap

## Complete Binary Tree

Every level in the binary tree, is completely filled, except possibly the last level where all vertices are as far left as possible

## Properties

- The largest element is always stored at the root of the tree
- Height â‰¤ $O(\log N )$  since we will store it as a complete binary tree

> ðŸ’¡ Stability of equal highest key: Might need to attach extra info (eg arrival time) to ascertain which is higher/which to take out first

## 1-based Compact Array

Indices of sorted order range from 1 to N

- Parent(i) == $\lfloor i \div 2 \rfloor$
- left_child(i) == $i \times 2$
- right_child(i) == $i \times 2 + 1$

## Operations

### Insert

Insertion of new item v into the binary heap can only be done at last index N + 1 to maintain the compact array â†’ enforce complete binary tree property

#### Implementation

HOWEVER, the max heap property may still be violated.

- Perform a bubbleUp operation that fixes the max heap property from the insertion point upwards (if necessary)â€¦.
- Continuous bubbleUp stops when there is no more max heap property violation ie all parent > child

#### Time Complexity

$O(\log N)$ worst case is when we insert a new element v that is greater than the current root value. This insertion would cause the bubbleUp operation from a leaf to the root and therefore runs in  $O(\log N)$ â†’ height of complete binary tree

### ExtractMax()

#### Implementation

Deletion of the maximum element (the root) of the binary max heap requires an existing element to replace the root.

- Remove the root
- Swap root and vertice at last index N
- New root most likely violates max heap property, so:
- Compare with the 2 children and bubbleDown with the larger of the 2 children â†’ to maintain the max heap property

#### Time Complexity

$O(logN)$ worst case is when we swap with element that is smaller than all other nodes. This insertion would cause the bubbleDown operation from the root back to a leaf and therefore run in $O(logN)$ â†’ height of complete binary tree

### Create(A)

Creates a valid Binary Max Heap from an input array A of N integers into an initially empty Binary Max Heap

#### Implementation 1

Simply insert (that is, by callingÂ **Insert(v)**Â operation) allÂ **N**Â integers of the input array into an initially empty Binary Max Heap one by one.

#### Time Complexity

Calling of `insert(v)` N times for every element added. Hence, time complexity is $O(N \log N)$.

Worst Case: Sorted ascending array â†’ every new insertion triggers a path from the leaf to the root $O(\log N)$ height.

#### Implementation 2

> ðŸ’¡ Compact array = Complete binary tree

> ðŸ’¡ All leaves (i.e., half of the vertices) are Binary Max Heap by default.

Hence, we can only fix Binary Max Heap property (if necessary) only from the last internal vertex back to the root.

You must iterate from N/2 to 1 for bubbleDown in create(A) if not it might fuck up your bubbleDown and violate your completeness invariant

#### Time Complexity

Time complexity seems to be $O((N/2) * \log N) \approx O(N \log N)$ but â€¦.

1. Height of full binary tree of size N is $\log_2 N$
2. Cost of running bubbleDown(i) is $O(h), h =$  height of subtree rooted at $i$
3. There are $\lceil N/2 ^ {h+1} \rceil$  vertices at height $h$

```
At level (leaf + 1) at most 1 swap
At level (leaf + 2) at most 2 swaps
â€¦
â€¦
number of work = height : at height k, at most k swaps
```

Thus, time complexity â†’ $O(N)$

### HeapSort()

Extracts elements out from highest to lowest priority by repeated calling ExtractMax() N times to get a sorted list, extracted elements are added to the head of a linked list

#### Time Complexity

$O(N \log N)$ , as ExtractMax() which takes $O(\log N)$  time is called $N$  times

### UpdateKey(i, newVal)

Updates the key value of Node with index i with newVal

#### Implementation

Simply call `A[i] = newVal;`

Then, call both shiftUp(i) and shiftDown(i) on it, of which only at most 1 of max heap property restoration operation will be successful. 

#### Time Complexity

$O(\log n)$ as at most move up to root or move down to leaf, provided we know index i.

### Delete(i)

Delete an existing value that is already inside the binary heap (is not the root)

#### Implementation

Simply update:

- `A[i] = A[1] + 1` a number greater than the current root, then call shiftUp(i)
- Alternatively, `updateKey(i, A[1] + 1)` does the same
- This floats index i to the new root, in which we can call ExtractMax() once to remove

#### Time Complexity

$O(\log n)$, provided we know i.

#### What if we are given `oldVal` instead of the index *i*?

Looping through index *i* will cost us $O(n)$  

Instead we can use a Hash Table to help us retrieve in $O(1)$.
