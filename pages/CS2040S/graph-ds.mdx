# Graph Data structures

## Properties of Graph

- Made up of vertices/nodes and edges/lines that connect these vertices
- Directed/Undirected (to represent association)
- Weighted/Unweighted (represent a numerical association for each edge)

### Simple Graph

- No self-loop edges
- No multiple/parallel edges (edges between same pair of vetices)

> ðŸ’­ Notably, the range of the number of edges in a simple graph is $[0, V^2]$

### Terminology

**Incident:** An edge is **incident** with its 2 end-point vertices

**Adjacent:** 2 vertices are **adjacent** if they are incident with a common edge. This might differ in a directed graph where say u â†’ v, then v is adjacent to u but not u adjacent to v

**Degree:** The degree of a vertex is the number of edges it is incident with. Has to be differentiated in a directed graph (ie in-degree, out-degreee)

**Isolated vertex:** A vertex with degree 0

**Subgraph:** A smaller graph that contains a subset of vertices and edges of the original graph

**Path:** A sequence of vertices such that there is an edge betweenÂ **$v_i, v_{i+1} \forall i âˆˆ [0..n-1]$**

**Simple path:** A path with no repeated vertex

**Connected Graph:** There exists a path between every pair of distinct vertices in the graph

**Connected Component:** 

- Component is a subgraph of the original graph
- Component is connected
- No connected subgraph of the original graph has this component as a subgraph and contains verticers/edges not in the component. Essentially, the component is the maximal subgraph that satisfies the above criteria

<aside>
ðŸ’­ In a directed graph, strongly connected components if there is a path between every pair of vertices in the component.

</aside>

**Cycle:** Path that starts and ends with the same vertex

**Acyclic graph:** Graph that contains no cycle

**Trivial Cycle:** Each undirected edge cases a trivial cycle (of length 2) â†’ not conventionally classified as a cycle

**Sparse Graph:** A graph in which the number of edges is much less than the possible number of edge

**Source/target:** In an edge $(u,v)$ , $u$ is the source vertex and $v$  is the target vertex â†’ notably for directed graphs.

### Special Graphs

- Tree
    - An undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path
    - Connected acyclic undirected sparse graph
- Complete Graph
    - Every pair of vertices are connected by an edge
    - **$E = V*(V-1)/2$**Â edges
    - Densest simple graph
    - Complete Digraph: $E = V*(V-1)$
- Bipartite Graph
    - A set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent
    - Free from odd-length cycle
    - Is complete when all m vertices from 1 disjoint set are connected to all n vertices in the other disjoint set

<aside>
ðŸ’­ A Tree is also a Bipartite Graph, i.e., all vertices on the even levels form one set, and all vertices on the odd levels form the other set.

- Directed Acyclic Graph
    - Relevant for Dynamic Programming
    - Has at least one topological sort/order
- Planar Graph
- Line Graph
- Star Graph
- Wheel Graph

## Graph Data Structure

Graph Data Structures can be represented in 3 different ways, Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List and Edge List. There is no one best representation, and we should choose which to implement depending on our usage.

### Adjacency Matrix

Square matrix, where entry `AM[i][j]` represents the edgeâ€™s weight from vertex i to j. For unweighted graphs, we can set weight = 1 for all edge weights

> ðŸ’­ We usually use `AM[i][j] = 0` to denote that there is no edge (i,j). However, if the graph contains 0-weighted edge(s), then we need to use another symbol to indicate no edge (for e.g., -1, `None`, `null`)

#### Space Complextiy

$O(V^2 )$, regardless of how sparse the graph is.

### Adjacency List

Array of V lists, one list for each vertex where `AL[i]` stores the list of iâ€™s neighbours.

For weighted graphs, we can store pairs representing (neighbour vertex number, weight of edge)

#### Space Complexity

$O(V+E)$, much more efficient than Adjacency Matrix and usually the default graph data structure in most graph algorithms.

### Edge List

Collection of edges with both connecting vertices and their weights, sorted by increasing weight (Kruskalâ€™s algorithm) for Minimum Spanning Tree problems.

#### Space Complexity

$O(E)$, much more efficient than Adjacency Matrix and as efficient as Adjacency List
