# Search Vertices

## Implementation

```java
Set this = root 
if this == null
  return null
else if this key == search value
  return this
else if this key < search value
  search right
else search left
```

> ðŸ’¡ The `higher()` function in Java TreeSet has a very similar implementation to search(v) but returns the smallest value > v (unless v > the largest element in the BST then there is no lower bound)

Implemented in $O(h)$  time complexity, where $h$ is the height of the BST. 

### SearchMin() and SearchMax()

SearchMin() - Return the value of the left most leaf vertex

SearchMax() - Return the value of the right most leaf vertex

Implemented in $O(h)$  time complexity, where $h$ is the height of the BST.

Insert(v) - Implemented in $O(N)$ as we need to use an insertion-sort ish strategy to ensure array remains sorted
