# Finding Successor and Predecessor of a vertice

## Successor(v)

```java
If current has a right child:
		return searchMin(this.right) //successor is the minimum value of the right subtree
else:
		parent = this.parent
		current = this
		//while the vertex is not the root
		//and it is not the right child of its parent (then it will be > parent)
		while (parent != null) && (current == parent.right) 
				current = parent
				parent = current.parent

		if parent == null: //the root vertex
				return current

		else return parent
```

Implemented in $O(h)$  time complexity, where $h$ is the height of the BST.

## Predecessor(v)

```java
If current has a left child:
		return searchMax(this.left) //successor is the minimum value of the right subtree
else:
		parent = this.parent
		current = this
		//while the vertex is not the root
		//and it is not the right child of its parent (then it will be > parent)
		while (parent != null) && (current == parent.left) 
				current = parent
				parent = current.parent

		if parent == null: //the root vertex
				return current

		else return parent
```
