# Order Statistics of vertex

We can implement the order statistic function by selecting the k-th smallest element `select(k)` or finding the rank of a specific vertex `rank(v)`

## Rank(v)

Given a key **v**, determine what is its rank (1-based index) in the sorted order of the BST elements. That is, Rank(FindMin()) = 1 and Rank(FindMax()) = **N**. If **v** does not exist, we can report -1

```java
node = root of BST
ans = 0
while (v != node.key) 
		if (v < node.key)
				node = node.left
		else
				ans += node.left.size + 1
				node = node.right
ans += node.left.size + 1
return ans
```

## Select(k)

Find the **k**-th smallest element in the BST. That is, Select(1) = FindMin() and Select(**N**) = FindMax()

```java
node = root of BST
left = node.left.size
while (left + 1 != k)
		if (left + 1 > k)
				node = node.left
		else 
				node = node.right
return node
```

## Implementation

For the effective implementation of `rank(v)` and `select(k)` , store an additional attribute in each vertex → size, which represents the size of the subtree rooted in that vertex (including the root)
