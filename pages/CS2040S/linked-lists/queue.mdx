# Queue

Abstract Data Type, in which collection are kept in order

Implemented usually by using a Singly Linked List

Addition of items to the back, Removal of items from the front → First-in-first-out (FIFO) Data Structure

# Implementation Issues with using (circular) Array

- Removal of elements at the front of a compact array → shift N-1 items → O(N) slow performance
- Implementing a circular array is okay if we are sure queue size always < array size
- However, if our array implementation of queue is full, we may need to enlarge (double) the size of the array → re-copying items from index front to back in O(N) process.

# Implementing Queue using 2 stacks

- 2 Stacks, one for ingoing elements, one to store outgoing elements
- Put the elements into the ingoing stack
- If enqueue(), push the enqueueing element into the ingoing stack
- If dequeue(), pop the elements from the ingoing stack to the outgoing stack, then pop() the first element of the outgoing stack

# Implementing Queue using Singly Linked List

- Only need the 2 extreme ends of the List, for insertion (enqueue) and removal (dequeue)
- Note that insertion after tail and removal at head from Singly Linked List are fast, O(1).
- Designate head/tail as front/end of queue respectively.
- In this implementation, enqueueing and dequeueing operations are all O(1).
