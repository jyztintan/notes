# Deque 

The double-ended queue (deque) is an Abstract Data Type that generalizes a Queue, for which elements can be added to or removed only fromÂ **either**Â the front (head) or back (tail).

## Implementation

Protected Doubly Linked List where we can only:

- Search the head/tail item (peek front/back) at $O(1)$
- Insert item to head/tail at $O(1)$
- Remove item at head/tail at $O(1)$

> ðŸ’¡ All these operations are O(1) because we can traverse forward and backwards from the head/tail pointer

## Applications

- Finding shortest paths 0/1-weighted graphs using modified BFS
- Sliding window techniques
