# Union-Find Disjoint sets

Used to model a collection of disjoint sets

Each tree represents a disjoint set (collection of disjoint sets → forest of trees)

Root of each tree is the representative item of the disjoint set


## Implementation

Represented with an array `p` of size `N` where `p[i] = parent(i)` and if `p[i] = i` , then `i` is the root of the tree → representative item of the set that contains item `i` 

Another array `rank` of size `N` , rank[i] = upperbound of the height of subtree rooted at vertex `i`

## Usages (In nearly $O(1)$  time)

- Determine which set an item belongs to
- Test if 2 items are in the same set
- Union 2 disjoint sets when necessary
- Find connected components in an undirected graph
- Kruskal’s algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree problem

## Heuristics

### Union-Rank

## Operations

### Initialize(N, M)

#### Implementation

1. Default form is Initialize(N, N), with all p[i] = i and rank[i] = 0 → N disjoint sets/items
2. We randomly pick 2 disjoint sets and merge them until we have only M disjoint sets.

> 💡 Due to the union-by-rank heuristics and randomness → unlikely to create tall trees

#### Time Complexity

$O(N)$

### FindSet(i)

#### Implementation

From vertex i, recursively go up the tree, until we find its root (when `p[i] = i` )

#### Time Complexity

Path-compression heuristic after each call of FindSet(i) → every single vertex along the path from vertex i to root knows that the root is their representative item → point directly in $O(1)$


> ‼️ By path-compression heuristic, each path from root to median vertices are  compressed

> 💡 Note that rank value of rank[1] is now incorrect as vertex 1 now becomes a leaf. We don’t update it because it is expensive.

### IsSameSet(i, j)

#### Implementation

Simply check if FindSet(i) == FindSet(j)

> 💡 This function is used extensively in Kruskal’s algorithm → to check if they are already connected or not

#### Time Complexity

As it only calls FindSet twice, we can assume $O(1)$  time ??

> 💡 FindSet function is invoked in IsSameSet, so path-compression heuristic is implicitly used

### UnionSet(i, j)

#### Implementation

```java
if items i and j come from 2 disjoint sets initially {
		if i.rank (height) > j.rank (height) {
				link representative (root) of j to representative (root) of i;
		else {
				link representative (root) of i to representative (root) of j;
} else nothing;
```

#### Time Complexity

$O(1)$ 

#### Heuristics

- Union-by-rank heuristic in action → resultant tree is relatively short, will never exceed original height + 1 (only in worst case where both trees are of equal height)
- isSameSet, FindSet function is invoked in UnionSet, so path-compression heuristic is implicitly used
- Each time path-compression heuristic compresses a path, at least one rank value will be incorrect. We do not fix these rank values as they are merely guiding heuristics for this UnionSet function.

## Actual Time Complexities

We say that FindSet(i), IsSameSet(i, j), UnionSet(i, j) runs in $O(1)$ time but they actually run in $O(α(N))$ time, if our UFDS is implemented with both path-compression and union-by-rank heuristics. , where α(N) represents the inverse Ackermann function. 

For practical usage of this UFDS data structure (assuming **N ≤ 1M**), we have α(**1M**) ≈ 1
