# Binary Search Tree


## BST Property

- Every vertex can have up to 2 children
- We allow duplicate integers by storing a frequency attribute of the duplicate key so that:
- Every vertex in the left subtree of a given vertex must carry a value **strictly** smaller than that of the given vertex
- Every vertex in the right subtree of a given vertex must carry a value **strictly** larger than that of the given vertex
- Dynamic data structure ‚Üí remains efficient after many update operations

## Structure

Root vertex - The unique vertex with no parent

Leaf vertices - Vertices with no children

Internal vertices - Vertices that are not leaves 

> üí° Occasionally, the root vertex is excluded from the definition of internal vertex as a BST with only the root vertex fits the definition of a leaf as well

## Applications/Operations

Balanced BSTs are effective data structures for implementing Table ADTs where keys must be **ordered**. 

> üí° Hash table perform table ADT operations inefficiently, so choosing between implementing a hash table or BST depends on which functions we want to optimise


[Search(v)](./binary-search-tree/search.mdx)

[Successor(v)/Predecessor(v)](./binary-search-tree/successor-predecessor.mdx)

[In-Order Traversal](./binary-search-tree/in-order-traversal.mdx)

[Insert(v)/Remove(v)](./binary-search-tree/insert-remove.mdx)

[Select(k)/Rank(v)](./binary-search-tree/select-rank.mdx)

Note that it is possible for $h = N$, where $N$  is the number of elements in the BST when the BST is fully skewed one direction.

> üí° If we used hash table, where keys are in ‚Äúrandom‚Äù order, these new operations cannot be done **efficiently** for `rank(v)` and `select(k)` as the keys are not ordered

### Bounds of BST Height

**Lower Bound:** The height in which we can insert N elements in perfect order such that the BST is perfectly balanced.

$h = \lfloor \log_2N \rfloor$ 

Upper **Bound:** The height in which we can insert N elements in ascending order to get skewed right BST

$h = N-1$

## No of structurally different BSTs with xx Elements

Number of permutations = $\frac{2n\choose n}{n+1}$ 

## Min Vertices given xx Height

$= h+1$

## Max Vertices given xx Height

$= 2^{h+1} -1$
