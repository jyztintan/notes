# Hash Table

Map keys to values (may be non-Integer keys/values) without using comparisons 

## Hash Function

### Advantages

Hashing allows us to associate every value of type \<T\> with an integer, where T can be any arbitrary type. Hence we are able to 

- Map non-Integer keys to Integer keys
- Map large Integers to smaller Integers

> 💭 Note that the hash function is usually not injective so we cannot “undo” a hash (inverse hashing)

### Hashing Strings

```java
int hash_function(string v) { // assumption 1: v uses ['A'..'Z'] only
  int sum = 0;                // assumption 2: v is a short string
  for (auto& c : v) // for each character c in v
    sum = ((sum*26)%M + (c-'A'+1))%M; // M is table size
  return sum;
}
```

Mapping Strings to Integer keys. The point of this is for us to obtain a key value of strings so that we can find them in our hashmap.

### After Hashing

With hashing, we can now implement the following Table ADT operations using Integer array (instead of Boolean array) as follows:

1. Search(v): Check if **A[h(v)] != -1** (we use -1 for an empty cell assuming **v ≥ 0**),
2. Insert(v): Set **A[h(v)] = v** (we hash **v** into **h(v)** so we need to somehow record key **v**),
3. Remove(v): Set **A[h(v)] = -1** 

If we have keys that map to satellite data and we want to record the original keys too, we can implement the Hash Table using pair of (Integer, satellite-data-type) array as follows:

1. Search(v): Return **A[h(v)]**, which is a **pair (v, satellite-data)**, possibly empty,
2. Insert(v, satellite-data): Set **A[h(v)] = pair(v, satellite-data)**,
3. Remove(v): Set **A[h(v)] = (empty pair)**

### Properties of Hash

1. Fast - $O(1)$ 
2. Deterministic - If performing hashing on the same key, we should always get the same value
3. Distribute Key evenly - Reduce chances of hash collision, which takes time to resolve.

The main idea is to ensure that  $1 + \alpha$  (Cost of hash + traversing LL) \<\<\<\<\< n

### Best Practice

**h(v) = v%M**

- M should be a reasonably large prime number
- M should not be near a power of 2
- Size M is > 2x larger than the expected number of keys N
- Low load factor $\alpha = \frac{M}{N}$ , M = number of slots in Hash Table, N = number of keys
    - Albeit at expense of a lot of empty spaces
    - Fewer chance for collision
    - Faster probe sequence
    - Shorter chains in separate chaining

## Open Addressing

Hashed keys are located in a single array. The hash code of a key gives its base address.

Collisions are resolved by checking/probing multiple alternative addresses in the table based on a certain rule

**M** = HT.length = the current hash table size,

`base`= key%HT.length

`step` = the current probing step,

`secondary` = smaller_prime - key%smaller_prime (avoid zero)

We will soon see that the probing sequences of the three modes are:

#### Linear Probing

Calculated by i=(base+step*1) % M 

- Essentially when there is a collision put to the right
- Limitation: Primary Clustering

#### Quadratic Probing

Calculated by i=(base+step*step) % M

- When there is a collision, (index + one of [1, 4, 9, 16, 25 …])%M
- Limitation: Not guaranteed when high load value, secondary clustering may occur
- Resolution: If load factor < 0.5 and table size is an odd prime, we can guarantee that we eventually will find an empty slot

> 💭 Theoretically, secondary clusters are rare and should not happen because the hash function ***should*** distribute the keys evenly

#### Double Hashing

Calculated by i=(base+step*secondary) % M

- When there is a collision, (index + secondary hash fx)%M
- Limitation: Increased computational complexity

#### Lazy Deletion

For hash tables implemented by open addressing, we may ruin the probing sequence if we completely remove elements, causing us to be unable to find our object again.

Hence, when removing values, we instead overwrite slots with a special `DEL` value that can allow insertion (as if available), but is probed through when searching (as if occupied).

### Rehashing

Only necessary for Hash Table with open addressing

- Performance gets worse when $\alpha  \rarr 1$
- Quadratic probing may fail when $\alpha \geq 0.5$

Rehashing is necessary when these occur → rebuild new hash table, recalculate hashes and re-insert everything. Usually we use a new hash table with size $\approx$  2x the original.

#### Time complexity

$O(N+M)$
????? 

## Closed Addressing

Hash code of a key gives its fixed/closed base address. Collisions are resolved by appending the collided keys inside an auxiliary data structure identified by the base address

#### Separate Chaining

- Collection of Linked List
- **M** copies of auxiliary data structures, usually DLL. If two keys **a** and **b** both have the same hash value **i**, both will be appended to the (front/back) of Doubly Linked List **i** (using head/tail pointer) in $O(1)$)
- Location where keys are slotted in is completely dependent on the hash function
- Scan through whole linked list to find the object

#### Time Complexity

$O(1 + \alpha) \approx O(1)$ 

#### Space Complexity

$O(N+M)$
, M = number of elements, n = size of table

## Separate Chaining

- Used for Java HashMap as it only uses one hash function
- Better if potentially a lot of deletions
- Table never “fills up”
- Cache performance is not that good

## Open Addressing

- Requires usage of DEL marker
- Good for Hash Table applications with minimal deletions
- Prolonged probing length after many insertions then deletions
- No extra memory overhead
- Table may become full
- Better time complexity if $\alpha \lt 50\%$
