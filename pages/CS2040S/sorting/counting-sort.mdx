# Counting Sort

## Implementation

- Consists of frequency table
- Scan through elements and we do a frequency counting
- Increment element count by 1 as we check for elements
- Iterate through frequency table and print accordingly to frequency


## Space/Time complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(n+k)$, where *n* is the number of elements and *k* is the number of possible elements.
- Space Complexity: $O(n+k)$, where *n* is the number of elements and *k* is the number of possible elements.
- May not be able to use counting sort if $k$ (range of integers) is very large due to memory limitations
- $k$ may dominate $n$ â†’ reduce efficiency
