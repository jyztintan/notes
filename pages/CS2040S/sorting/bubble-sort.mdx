# Bubble Sort

## Implementation

- Iterates through array and swaps if $left > right$, esentially “floats” elements to the right of the array $n- 1$ times
- Notice that after $k$  iteration of the sorting, the largest $k$ -th elements become sorted

## Space/Time Complexity

- Worst Case: $O(N^2)$ for example in decreasing lists
- No extra space is used, so $O(1)$  space complexity

## Early Termination

Optimised Bubble sort terminates if after one iteration, there is no swapping at all. This means that the array is already sorted so the process can terminate

However, time is still $O(N^2)$  by worst case.

## Bubble sort is a stable sort!
