# Selection Sort

## Implementation

- At every round, search for the smallest element out of the remaining unsorted array
- Swap smallesat element with the current pointer position
- At the end of the $k$-th iteration, the $k$ smallest elements are sorted in the right position

## Space/Time Complexity

- Always runs in $O(N^2)$ time complexity because it makes $n(n-1)/2$ comparisons
- Non-adaptive sorting (always the same time complexity)
- Runs in constant space, $O(1)$

## Not Stable Sort!
