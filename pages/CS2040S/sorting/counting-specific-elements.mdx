# Counting Specific elements

## Arbitrary Array

- Count specific elements $O(N)$  time complexity by performing 1 $O(N)$  pass through the array

## Sorted Array

- Modify binary search algorithm to return the lowest/highest index in $O(\log N)$  time complexity
- $Number \space of \space elements = Highest - Lowest + 1$
- Need to implement both `binary_search_lowest(array, val)` and `binary_search_highest(array, val)` to get respective indices of highest and lowest
- Time Complexity: $O(2 \log N) \approx O(\log N)$ time
