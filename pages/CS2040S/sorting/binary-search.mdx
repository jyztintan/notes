# Binary Search 

## Implementation

- It can only works on data that is sorted, usually in increasing order
- We want to search for `val` in a sorted list
- Check the halfway point, `mid`. Check if `val > mid` or `val < mid`.
    - If `val > mid`, we can just omit the entire left side
    - If `val < mid`, we can just omit the entire right side
- Repeat on the new midpoint and recursively look for `val`
- Binary search terminates after $O(\log n)$ rounds → discard half every round → $2^n$ elements will be reduced to 1 in roughly $n$  rounds.

## Usage

- `Collections.binarySearch()`
- If element is in the list, returns index of element in $O(\log n)$ time.
- Otherwise, returns $(-n-1)$, in which $n$ is the supposed actual index if it were to exist in the list.
