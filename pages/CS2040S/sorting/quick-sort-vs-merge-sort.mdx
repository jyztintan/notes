# Quick Sort vs Merge Sort

In this page, we will compare the various aspects of [(Randomised) Quick Sort](./randomised-quick-sort.mdx) and [Merge Sort](./merge-sort.mdx) algorithms

## Time Complexity

### Quick Sort

- Depth of recursion causes Quick Sort to use $O(\log N)$  space in the stack
- Each level takes $O(N)$  comparisons
- Time Complexity: $O(N\log N)$

### Merge Sort

- Merging a sorted list from two sorted lists → $O(N)$ = work done at every level
- Number of layers in merge sort = $\log n$
- Hence merge sort uses $O(N\log N)$  time complexity

### Conclusion

However,,,, the **constant factor** of quicksort is much lower than that of merge sort on average.

By the use of randomized pivots, we can reduce the chances of $O(N^2)$  happening…

## Space Complexity

### Quick Sort

Depth of recursion causes Quick Sort to use $O(\log N)$  space in the stack

### Merge Sort

- $O(N)$  space to store the auxiliary array

## Stability

MS is stable but QS is not
