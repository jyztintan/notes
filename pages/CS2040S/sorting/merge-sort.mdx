# Merge Sort

## Implementation

- Classic Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm
- Recursively sorts the 2 halves of the lists
- Merges the 2 lists together efficiently


## Space/Time Complexity

- A one element list is already sorted! (Base case) → $O(1)$
- Merging a sorted list from two sorted lists → $O(N)$ = work done at every level
- Number of layers in merge sort = $\log n$
- Hence merge sort uses $O(n\log n)$  time complexity
- $O(N)$  space to store the auxiliary array


## Stablility

- Most merge sorts are inherently stable because if leftValue ≤ rightValue, process the leftValue first
