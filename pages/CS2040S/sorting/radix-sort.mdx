# Radix Sort

Sorting by digits

## Implementation

- Sort by ones digit, then tens digit, then hundreds digitâ€¦ etc

## Time Complexity

- $O(w(N+k))$ time complexity, where $w$ is the number of digits, $N$ is the number of elements, and $k$ is the radix (i.e. 10 in this case).
- $O(N+k)$  space complexity, $N$ is the number of elements, and $k$ is the radix (i.e. 10 in this case).
