# Insertion Sort

## Implementation

- Maintain a sorted array on the left and insert elements in sorted order
- At the end of the $k$-th iteration, the $k$ smallest elements are sorted BUT not necessarily in the right position

## Space/Time Complexity

- Worst Case: $O(N^2)$ time complexity but is adaptive!
- Runs in $O(N)$ time complexity for (nearly) sorted arrays
- Constant $O(1)$ space complexity

## Stable!
