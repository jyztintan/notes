# Notes to SoCcess

## Introduction

Welcome to Notes to SoCcess, a collection of my notes from modules in the School of Computing (SoC) at NUS.
I hope for this webpage to serve as a resource for fellow students and anyone interested in Computer Science.

If you spot any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/jyztintan/notes/issues/new?title=Feedback%20for%20%E2%80%9CNotes%E2%80%9D).
