# About

Welcome to my notes webpage! I'm Justin Tan, a Year 3 Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore, School of Computing (SoC). 
With a deep passion for Computer Science and teaching, I have been serving as a tutor for the modules CS1231S and CS1010A.

This website is crafted with the aim of giving back to the SoC community. 
Throughout my academic journey, I've compiled various notes and resources that have been instrumental in my studies. 
Recognizing the challenges and steep learning curve that we CS students face, I've decided to make these resources available to help you navigate our CS curriculum more effectively.

Feel free to explore, learn, and perhaps even contribute.
Let's make the journey through NUS Computer Science more enjoyable :\)

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find these resources helpful!
